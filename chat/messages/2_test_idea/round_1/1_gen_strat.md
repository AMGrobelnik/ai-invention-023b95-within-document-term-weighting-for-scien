<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A strategy planner (Step 3.1: GEN_STRAT in the invention loop)

Each iteration of the invention loop runs: GEN_STRAT → GEN_PLAN → GEN_ART → GEN_PAPER_TEXT → REVIEW_PAPER → UPD_HYPO
Artifact types: RESEARCH (web search), EXPERIMENT (code), DATASET (data collection), EVALUATION (metrics), PROOF (Lean 4)
State persists across iterations: strategies, plans, artifacts, paper_texts (read from the run tree)

You received the hypothesis, iteration status (current + remaining), previous iteration's strategies, available artifact types, existing artifacts, and reviewer feedback.
Your strategy governs THIS iteration only. You define what artifacts to create NOW.

Focused strategy → efficient progress. Scattered strategy → wasted iteration.

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budgets>

Each artifact executor has a fixed time budget (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors):

- research: 3h
- dataset: 6h
- experiment: 6h
- evaluation: 3h
- proof: 3h

</time_budgets>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<research_methodology>
Think like a researcher planning a study for a top venue.

- All strategies run in parallel and their artifacts combine into one pool. Together they must build toward a publishable paper — each strategy contributes a distinct, necessary piece. No strategy should be a standalone island.
- Ask yourself: what would a reviewer need to see? Proper baselines, controlled comparisons, ablations that isolate what matters. Plan artifacts that preempt reviewer objections.
- Depth over breadth. One well-designed experiment with proper controls beats five shallow ones.
- Match your evaluation to your claims. Measure what the hypothesis actually asserts.
- When results are weak or partial, vary the approach before writing it off. One failed method doesn't falsify the hypothesis.
- If iterations remain, think about what the NEXT iteration will need. Leave useful building blocks — datasets, baselines, preliminary results — that future strategies can build on, refine, or compare against.
</research_methodology>

<principles>
1. FOCUS ON NOVELTY - every strategy must lead to a genuinely novel contribution
2. MAXIMIZE PARALLELIZATION - all artifacts in your strategy run in parallel
3. BUILD ON EXISTING WORK - use completed artifacts from previous iterations, learn from failures
4. ITERATE ON THE METHOD - a negative result is about the approach, not the hypothesis. Try different methods, parameters, data, or formulations within the hypothesis bounds.
5. DIAGNOSE BEFORE DECIDING - before each iteration, review what worked, what didn't, and why. Use that to choose what to try next. Gaps are action items, not conclusions.
6. SET DEPENDENCIES WISELY - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects referencing existing artifacts; each label is a short free-text type (a word or two, e.g. "dataset", "validates", "extends") that tags how the dep is used
7. PLAN FOR DEPENDENCIES - if an artifact depends on another (e.g. experiments need datasets), ensure prerequisites exist first or plan them this iteration for the next
</principles>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
Your strategy should advance this hypothesis.

kind: hypothesis
title: Within-Doc Term Rarity Fixes Section Retrieval
hypothesis: >-
  Standard dense retrieval systematically mis-ranks sections within scientific PDFs because it treats query-term matches uniformly,
  regardless of how many sections in the same document share that term. We hypothesize that replacing cross-corpus IDF with
  an Intra-Document Inverse Section Frequency (ISF) — ISF(t) = log(N_sections / (1 + SF(t))), where SF(t) is the count of
  sections in the target paper containing term t — produces a TF-ISF score that better identifies the evidence-bearing sections.
  Specifically, 'document theme terms' (e.g., the paper's topic words) appear in nearly every section, providing no discriminative
  signal; meanwhile, section-specific terms (precise technique names, numeric variable identifiers, unique experimental conditions)
  appear in only one or two sections and are the true discriminative signal for locating evidence. TF-ISF up-weights section-specific
  terms and down-weights document theme terms, thereby counteracting the retrieval bias toward claim-dense sections (Abstract,
  Introduction, Conclusion) that repeat theme terms in query-friendly language while directing retrieval toward evidence-dense
  sections (Methods, Results) that contain section-unique terms. We predict this training-free, self-contained score improves
  section recall and downstream answer F1 on QASPER relative to a fixed-k cosine-similarity baseline.
motivation: >-
  Scientific question answering over long PDFs is increasingly important for automated literature review, clinical evidence
  synthesis, and research acceleration. Despite significant RAG advances, a structural failure mode in scientific documents
  remains unstudied: claim-dense sections (Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion) paraphrase findings in accessible language
  that closely mirrors natural-language queries, inflating their cosine similarity scores. Evidence-dense sections (Results,
  Methods) contain the verifiable, specific information needed for accurate answers but use specialized, low-frequency vocabulary
  that under-scores under standard retrieval. This claim/evidence vocabulary gap is not random noise — it is an artifact of
  how scientific papers are written (IMRaD convention mandates separating claims from evidence). TF-ISF directly corrects
  this bias using only the document itself, requiring no external training data, no rhetorical parser, no citation graph,
  and no LLM inference at retrieval time. The approach is also interpretable: the ISF score for each query term is directly
  readable from the document's own statistics.
assumptions:
- >-
  Scientific papers written in IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) format create a systematic vocabulary
  split: claim-summarizing sections repeat topic terms while evidence sections contain section-unique terms.
- >-
  QASPER (or a similar dataset) contains enough examples where the gold evidence is in Methods/Results sections (not Abstract/Introduction)
  to detect the difference between TF-ISF and cosine similarity.
- >-
  Within-document section frequency can be computed from simple tokenization and section boundary detection, which is reliable
  for structured scientific PDFs.
- >-
  The improvement in section retrieval (higher recall of gold evidence sections) translates to measurable gains in downstream
  answer F1 when a fixed-size context window is used.
- >-
  A cheap LLM reader (available via OpenRouter within the $10 budget) can generate answers from retrieved sections consistently
  enough that retrieval quality differences are reflected in answer F1.
investigation_approach: >-
  1) Load QASPER from HuggingFace; parse each paper's sections and their text. 2) Implement three retrieval methods: (a) top-k
  cosine similarity with sentence-transformers embeddings (baseline), (b) BM25 over sections using standard corpus-level IDF
  (strong baseline), and (c) TF-ISF using within-document section frequency for ISF computation. 3) For each query, retrieve
  the top-k=3 sections under each method. 4) Feed retrieved sections + query to a cheap LLM via OpenRouter (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct)
  and generate an answer. 5) Evaluate with token-level F1 against gold answers (QASPER's standard metric). 6) Also compute
  section-level recall (fraction of gold evidence sections retrieved in top-k) as an intermediate diagnostic. 7) Run a subgroup
  analysis: split queries by gold evidence section type (Abstract vs. Methods vs. Results) and compare retrieval performance
  per subtype across methods. This reveals whether TF-ISF specifically rescues cases where cosine fails to retrieve Methods/Results
  sections. Target: ~150–200 examples to stay within $10 LLM budget at approximately $0.01–0.05 per query.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRM: TF-ISF achieves ≥3 F1 points higher than top-k cosine baseline on QASPER answer F1, AND section-level recall of
  gold evidence sections is higher for TF-ISF than cosine (especially for questions with evidence in Results/Methods sections).
  An intermediate confirmation would be showing that Abstract/Introduction sections have systematically lower ISF scores (more
  document-theme terms) while Methods/Results sections have higher ISF scores (more section-unique terms) for the same queries.
  DISCONFIRM: If cosine or BM25 already retrieves gold sections with high recall (≥0.80), suggesting the vocabulary gap between
  claim and evidence sections is not large enough in practice to create a retrieval failure. PARTIAL: If TF-ISF improves section
  recall but not F1 (suggesting the bottleneck is reader quality, not retrieval), or if improvement is only visible on a specific
  subtype (e.g., numerical questions).
related_works:
- >-
  Disco-RAG (2025, arxiv 2601.04377): Builds intra-chunk RST discourse trees and inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to improve
  RAG coherence. Key difference: Disco-RAG requires an external discourse parser and focuses on discourse coherence for generation,
  while TF-ISF is a simple term-weighting formula computed purely from within-document statistics, requiring no external model
  and targeting retrieval rather than generation coherence.
- >-
  SF-RAG (2026, arxiv 2602.13647): Structure-Fidelity RAG preserves section hierarchy as a routing index and uses path-guided
  retrieval along the outline. Key difference: SF-RAG routes queries through a pre-built structural index; TF-ISF reweights
  term-section matches using within-document statistics, with no routing or indexing infrastructure required.
- >-
  CG-RAG (2025, arxiv 2501.15067): Citation-graph RAG builds intra- and inter-paper citation graphs for retrieval. Key difference:
  CG-RAG requires an external citation graph and focuses on inter-paper relationships. TF-ISF operates within a single document
  with no external resources.
- >-
  HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings, 2022): Generates a hypothetical answer document and retrieves by its embedding.
  Key difference: HyDE requires LLM generation at retrieval time and targets query-document mismatch via generation; TF-ISF
  targets the within-document claim/evidence vocabulary split via statistical term weighting, requiring zero LLM calls during
  retrieval.
- >-
  Ruling Out to Rule In — Contrastive Hypothesis Retrieval (2026, arxiv 2604.04593): Scores documents by Sim(doc, H+) - lambda*Sim(doc,
  H-) where H+/H- are target and mimic hypotheses. Key difference: CHR retrieves across a document corpus for medical QA;
  TF-ISF ranks sections within a single document using no competing hypotheses, only within-document term statistics.
- >-
  SURE-RAG (2026, arxiv 2605.03534): Sufficiency and uncertainty-aware evidence verification using set-level sufficiency judgments.
  Key difference: SURE-RAG is a post-retrieval verification step that assesses if retrieved evidence is sufficient; TF-ISF
  is a retrieval scoring function that changes which sections are retrieved in the first place.
inspiration: >-
  The core insight is TF-IDF applied at a finer granularity: just as cross-corpus IDF down-weights terms that appear in many
  documents (making them poor discriminators), within-document ISF down-weights terms that appear in many sections of the
  same paper. The mathematical framework is 50 years old (Sparck Jones 1972), but its application to the intra-document section-ranking
  problem in scientific RAG is new. The additional biological analogy is indicator species from ecology: just as ecologists
  use rare species whose presence precisely signals a particular habitat, TF-ISF identifies rare intra-document terms (section-specific
  vocabulary) as the most reliable indicators of a section's unique content. The hypothesis that this specifically corrects
  a systematic failure in scientific RAG is motivated by the IMRaD writing convention, which by design separates claim language
  (intro/conclusion) from evidence language (methods/results) — a structural feature absent in general-purpose documents.
terms:
- term: TF-ISF
  definition: >-
    Term Frequency × Inverse Section Frequency: a within-document term-weighting score where ISF(t) = log(N_sections / (1
    + SF(t))), SF(t) is the number of sections in the same document containing term t, and N_sections is the total number
    of sections. Analogous to TF-IDF but using per-document section counts as the 'document frequency'.
- term: Inverse Section Frequency (ISF)
  definition: >-
    The within-document analogue of IDF: a weight for term t in a given document computed as log(N_sections / (1 + SF(t))).
    Terms appearing in many sections of the same document receive low ISF (they are document theme terms); terms appearing
    in few sections receive high ISF (they are section-specific).
- term: Claim-dense section
  definition: >-
    A section of a scientific paper (typically Abstract, Introduction, or Conclusion) that summarizes findings and claims
    in accessible language, reusing the paper's main topic vocabulary. These sections score high under standard cosine similarity
    for typical queries but contain little verifiable evidence.
- term: Evidence-dense section
  definition: >-
    A section of a scientific paper (typically Methods or Results) that contains specific experimental procedures, quantitative
    outcomes, and precise technical terms unique to that section. These sections are the true answer source for most factual
    questions but score lower under cosine similarity due to specialized vocabulary.
- term: Document theme term
  definition: >-
    A term that appears in nearly every section of a given scientific paper (e.g., the paper's central topic noun). Theme
    terms have near-zero ISF and are uninformative for discriminating between sections.
- term: Section-specific term
  definition: >-
    A term that appears in only one or two sections of a document (e.g., a specific dataset name, model hyperparameter, or
    experimental condition). Section-specific terms have high ISF and strongly indicate the section's unique content.
- term: QASPER
  definition: >-
    A public benchmark dataset of 5,049 information-seeking questions over 1,585 NLP research papers, where each question
    is paired with gold answers and evidence annotations identifying the exact paper sections containing the answer.
summary: >-
  We hypothesize that standard cosine-similarity retrieval systematically mis-ranks sections in scientific PDFs by treating
  theme terms (shared across many sections) equally with section-specific terms, biasing retrieval toward claim-dense sections
  like Abstracts. Replacing cross-corpus IDF with a within-document Inverse Section Frequency (ISF) computed solely from the
  target paper's own section statistics corrects this bias without any training, discourse parsing, or LLM inference at retrieval
  time, and should improve answer F1 on QASPER over a fixed-k cosine baseline.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

RESEARCH executor scope:
  Output: research_out.json with {answer, sources, follow_up_questions} + research_report.md
  DOES: Web research — search, read, synthesize information from papers/docs/APIs into a structured report
  DOES NOT: Run code, download files, execute scripts, compute anything — no shell/Python access
  Use for literature surveys, API documentation, technical specifications — pure information gathering

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle

PROOF executor scope:
  Output: Lean 4 proof files (.lean) with verified theorems
  DOES: Write and verify Lean 4 formal proofs with Mathlib, iterative compilation
  DOES NOT: Run Python experiments, collect data, do empirical analysis
  Use only when formal mathematical guarantees are needed
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
RESEARCH: Plan early — findings guide dataset selection, experiment design, and methodology.
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
PROOF: Use only when the hypothesis requires formal mathematical guarantees. Lean 4 + Mathlib.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

### [3] HUMAN-USER prompt · 2026-07-20 10:13:00 UTC

```
A compact retrieval-augmented summarizer for long scientific PDFs that ranks sections by query relevance, benchmarked on a small QA set for answer F1 against a fixed top-k baseline.
```

### [4] ASSISTANT · 2026-07-20 10:14:24 UTC

```
Looking at this task, I need to generate ONE research strategy for iteration 1 of 2 that will advance the TF-ISF hypothesis. The hypothesis is specific and testable: standard dense retrieval mis-ranks sections in scientific PDFs, and a within-document inverse section frequency (ISF) metric should fix this by down-weighting document theme terms and up-weighting section-specific terms.

Let me design a strategy that runs the core empirical test efficiently:

**Strategy overview:**
- **DATASET** artifact to prepare QASPER with proper section parsing and annotation
- **EXPERIMENT** artifact to implement and evaluate all three methods (cosine, BM25, TF-ISF) with LLM-based answer generation
- **EVALUATION** artifact to run statistical tests and diagnostic analysis of the vocabulary hypothesis

This builds a complete pipeline to either confirm the hypothesis (TF-ISF ≥3 F1 points above cosine baseline) or identify where the vocabulary assumption breaks down.
```

Strategy generation complete. I've created **one focused research strategy** to empirically test the TF-ISF hypothesis on QASPER in iteration 1.

**Strategy: "Implement and validate TF-ISF for section retrieval"**

The strategy runs three parallel artifacts that build a complete pipeline:

1. **DATASET** — Parse QASPER from HuggingFace, extract sections with type annotations (Abstract, Methods, Results, etc.), create mini (50) and full (150–200) splits balanced for $10 LLM budget.

2. **EXPERIMENT** — Implement all three methods:
   - Cosine similarity baseline (sentence-transformers)
   - BM25 strong baseline (corpus-level IDF)
   - TF-ISF (within-document section frequency)
   
   For each query, retrieve top-k=3 sections per method, feed to Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct (OpenRouter), generate answers, compute token-level F1 and section-level recall.

3. **EVALUATION** — Run statistical significance tests (paired t-tests with Holm correction), subgroup analysis by evidence section type, and diagnostic checks of the vocabulary hypothesis (ISF score distributions across section types). Determine CONFIRM/PARTIAL/DISCONFIRM status.

**Why this strategy:**
- Tests the core hypothesis claim directly: does ISF correctly identify section-specific vocabulary?
- Success is measurable and clear (≥3 F1 point improvement + higher recall)
- Provides diagnostic evidence to explain failures and inform iteration 2
- Fits within time (6h experiment) and budget ($10 LLM calls)
- All three artifacts run in parallel, maximizing iteration efficiency
